VCS: A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that tracks and manages changes to files, enabling collaboration and rollback.
Git: A distributed version controll system enabling seamless colaboration among developers.
Why is Git Needed?
Collaboration:
Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
Pull requests and code reviews improve the quality of contributions.

Backup and Recovery:Keeps a complete history of changes, making it possible to restore previous versions of files.
Branch Management: Enables development on multiple features simultaneously without affecting the main project.
Auditability:Logs every change, showing who made it, when, and why (with commit messages).
Efficiency in Development:Simplifies the process of updating and sharing code.
Helps in identifying and resolving conflicts in the codebase quickly.
Examples of When Git is Used
Team Collaboration: Developers working on a project like building a website or application.
Open Source Projects: Git is the backbone of platforms like GitHub, where developers worldwide contribute to projects.
Experimentation: Developers can try new ideas on branches without disrupting the main code.
Git is an essential tool for modern software development, ensuring that projects are scalable, maintainable, and collaborative.
